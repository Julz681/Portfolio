    <h2>About <span>me</span></h2>
    <p>
      Hey there, I'm Judith and I'm {{ age }} years old! <br />
      With a background in business administration and a Master’s degree in
      Business Management, I bring a strategic mindset to the world of software
      development. After completing my commercial training and gaining
      leadership experience in a consulting company, I decided to expand my
      skill set and pursue my passion for web development. I find joy in
      creating intuitive user interfaces and building solutions that make an
      impact.

        I’m highly motivated to keep growing as a developer and am always
        curious to explore new technologies. My passion for coding is driven by
        a desire to build meaningful digital products and continuously challenge
        myself intellectually.

        I approach problem-solving with analytical thinking, creativity, and
        persistence — and I believe that collaboration is key to developing
        great software. Whether I’m working independently or in a team, I value
        clean code, constructive feedback, and lifelong learning.
