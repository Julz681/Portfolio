    <h2>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can
      activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
      uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
      choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
      adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
      practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
    </p>

      Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we
      may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or
      by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
      Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your
