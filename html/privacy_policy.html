        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your

        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.

      <h2>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
      </p>

      <h2>8. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>

      <p>
        <b>In Short:</b> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay
        compliant with relevant laws.

        We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version
        will be indicated by an updated 'Revised' date at the top of this
        Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we
        may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or
        by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
        Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your
        information.
